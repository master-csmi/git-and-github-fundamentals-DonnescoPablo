# Introduction

Hello! I am MEDESSI Seithondji Dieudonne.   
I am learning more about Git and Github.

# Things I have learned

Before reading basics of GitHub, some of its terms looked strange for me :smile:. I cite many of them:
* Forks
* Issues
* Pull requests   

But now, for example, I can distinguish the difference between **cloning** and **forking** a repository.

# Things I am still confused about

This brief documentation about the basics of GitHub is made very well and is well explained. It points out essential tools so I can say that every thing is clear for me :smile: now.
